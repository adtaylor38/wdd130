        <p class ="engineer-paragraph">During my time at Brigham Young University, I dabbled in Computer Science classes out of sheer curiosity. To my delight, I discovered that I enjoyed them, and many of the concepts seemed to click with me. As I continued my journey working at the laboratory, I found myself increasingly drawn to coding and began taking small courses to develop my skills. Part of this newfound interest was sparked by my brother-in-law, a seasoned software engineer, whose descriptions of his work piqued my curiosity and motivated me to explore further.</p>
        <p class ="engineer-paragraph2">Subsequently, I made the decision to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Software Development at Brigham Young University, with the aim of delving deeper into the field and honing my skills. My ultimate aspiration is to embark on a career as a Software Engineer. This website serves not only as a portfolio but also as a representation of my progress. Over the years, it will showcase a growing collection of projects that I undertake. As I continue to learn and evolve, the site will serve as a testament to my ability to create and maintain websites, further demonstrating my expertise in the field.</p>
