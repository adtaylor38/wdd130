    <h2> Website Proposal</h2>
    <p> For my website, I would like to create a type of digital resume. I want the site to reflect who 
        I am and where I am in my learning process, as well as demonstrate some of the projects that I 
        will work on over the coming years. It will mainly be for potential employers, but could be used
        as a digital business card for anyone interested in getting to know me. </p>
